  - **Objective**: building an acceloremeter dataset for building and evaluating biometrics models
  - **Methods**: recorded 18 activities with phone and watch acceloremeter sensors
  - **Outcomes**: Open Dataset 
  - **Relation to the Project**: offers non epileptic acceloremeter data

- **Source 2**: Generalized Models for the Classification of Abnormal Movements in Daily Life and its Applicability to Epilepsy Convulsion Recognition

  - **[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354194/]()**
  - **Objective**: Generating a type of model that can evaluate the generalization capabilities
  - **Methods**: healthy participants simulate a seizure with a 3d accelerometer. Classic machine learning methodes are evaluated
  - **Outcomes**: suggests a new measurement of model performances and highlights the effectiveness of the tested models
  - **Relation to the Project**: offers non epileptic and epileptic acceloremeter data
